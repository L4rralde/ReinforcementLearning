# My reinforcement learning journey

This is my first project while being a full time engineer and as college graduate. Honestly, I have been struggling with my 20s crisis since I found no motivation from my current and first full time job. Anyway, this new personal project is one of the few reasons that I can still beliebve in myself.

So far I have implemented a Q-Learning algorithm and a Monte Carlo Tree Search or MCTS. I tested them with some games from openAI's gym module. My Q-learning algorithm implementation performs well for very small environments while I cannot say the same for the MCTS.

Thanks! I wanted you to know that I really appreciate that you explore this repo.
